# NotHuman
My first frontend website using HTML5 CSS3 

 NotHuman -> this website is not interactive.
 It is responsive in all kinds of devices and code is refactored in good way so that everyone can understand easily.
 Used data-aos for transition properties.
 Please do visit , provide feedback and contribute if any.

 ->Double click the index.html or open with live server.
Refrence from legend Mosh Hamedani.
